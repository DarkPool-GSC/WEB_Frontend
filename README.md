> For he who has health, has hope.
> And he who has hope, has everything.

A beautiful saying by Owen Arthur, it only highlights the misfortune of living in a world, where not everyone can afford to care for their own wellbeing. It's a tragedy, that only a very priveleged section of our society finds healthcare accessible and affordable. Millions of people around in India suffer deeply due to this glaring flaw in our society, and our project, Remedinow, sets out to mend this.

# But why this project?
_India has the misfortune of having one of the most inefficient healthcare systems in the world. Apart from the usual factors of unqualified doctors and uneducated patients, our team felt that the major contributor to millions of tragedies every year in healthcare is the mismanagement of patients and their valuable time. Currently, if a patient wants to get checked at one of the hospitals, he has to go through a tedious process of filling out various forms, which can be a task if the patient requires urgent care. Very often, if the hospital has a rush, the patient has to sit through long hours. After going through the redundant form filling, the hospital authorities are often unable to maintain the correct record of a patient, which leads to a miscommunication with the Doctors and causes further frustration to the already aggravated patients. Even if a patient can get the prescription without any hitches, he may be unable to take his medicine at the right time due to his schedule._

Our project, Remedinow, was created with the sole aim of removing all these hurdles, and making Healthcare available for all.

# SUSTAINABLE GOALS TARGETED BY OUR PROJECT 

*  ## Good Health and Wellbeing
    * An efficient appointment booking system can help patients schedule their appointments at a convenient time, reducing stress and anxiety with missing important appointments. Patients who have regular appointments with their healthcare providers are more likely to feel cared for and supported.
    * Patients who feel their healthcare provider is accessible and responsive are more likely to have positive outcomes and report higher levels of satisfaction with their care.
    * One of the biggest benefits of our medicine reminder is that it can help patients stick to their medication schedule more consistently.  Taking medicines at the right time is crucial to managing chronic health conditions and preventing complications. Our reminder system can help patients take their medicine on time, reducing the risk of missed doses or double doses, which can lead to adverse health effects.
*  ## Reduced Inequalities
    *  Our project is particularly beneficial for people who live in remote or underserved areas, and who may not have easy access to healthcare services. By making it easier for these individuals to schedule appointments our aim is to reduce disparities in healthcare access. 
*  ## Quality Education
    *  There are several people from marginalized communities who do not have access to basic health and hygiene education. These people spend their income on necessities like food and fuel, receiving no information about basic hygiene tips. 
As a result of incorporating these basic healthcare tips in our project, we strive to enlighten the deprived sectionâ€™s future in a positive manner. By making these a part of their daily lives, they will become less vulnerable to diseases.
